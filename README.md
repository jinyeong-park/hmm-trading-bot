Create settings.yaml with ALL parameters, grouped by section, with default and comments:

- broker (paper_trading: true, symbols: [VOO, VTI, VT, SPYM, QQQM, VWO, HFGM, GOOGL, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, AMD, GLD], timeframe: 1Day)
- hmm (n_candidates: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], n_init: 10, covariance_type: full, min_train_bars: 252, stability_bars: 3, flicker_window: 20, flicker_threshold: 4, min_confidence: 0.55)

Create .env.example with:
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
ALPACA_PAPER=true

Do NOT implement any logic yet — just the skeleton with imports, class stubs, type hints, and docstrings.
Add .env and credentials.yaml to .gitignore.

---

## Phase 2: HMM Regime Detection Engine

Implement core/hmm_engine.py and data/feature_engineering.py.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: The HMM is a VOLATILITY CLASSIFIER. It detects whether the market  
is in a calm, moderate, or turbulent volatility environment. It does NOT predict price direction. The strategy layer uses the volatility classification to set portfolio allocation — be fully invested when conditions are calm, reduce when turbulent.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. GAUSSIAN HMM WITH AUTOMATIC MODEL SELECTION:
   - Test n_components = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] during training
   - For each candidate, train and compute BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
   - BIC = -2 _ log_likelihood + n_params _ log(n_samples)
   - Select lowest BIC score (simplest model that explains the data)
   - Run multiple random initializations per candidate (n_init=10)
   - Log ALL candidate BIC scores and which was selected

After training, sort regimes by mean return (ascending) for LABELING:

- Lowest return → CRASH / BEAR
- Highest return → BULL / EUPHORIA
- Assign labels based on selected count:
  3 regimes: BEAR, NEUTRAL, BULL
  4 regimes: CRASH, BEAR, BULL, EUPHORIA
  5 regimes: CRASH, BEAR, NEUTRAL, BULL, EUPHORIA
  6 regimes: CRASH, STRONG_BEAR, WEAK_BEAR, WEAK_BULL, STRONG_BULL, EUPHORIA
  7 regimes: CRASH, STRONG_BEAR, WEAK_BEAR, NEUTRAL, WEAK_BULL, STRONG_BULL, EUPHORIA

  IMPORTANT: Labels are sorted by return for human readability. But the STRATEGY layer sorts by VOLATILITY independently. The labels don't drive strategy decisions.

2. OBSERVABLE FEATURES (inputs to HMM):
   Implement in data/feature_engineering.py as pure functions.

Compute from OHLCV:

- Returns: log returns over 1, 5, 20 periods
- Volatility: realized vol (20-period rolling std), vol ratio (5-period / 20-period)
- Volume: normalized volume (z-score vs 50-period mean), volume trend (slope of 10-period SMA)
- Trend: ADX (14-period), slope of 50-period SMA
- Mean reversion: RSI(14) z-score, distance from 200 SMA as % of price
- Momentum: ROC 10 and 20 period
- Range: normalized ATR (14-period ATR / close)

Standardize ALL features with rolling z-scores (252-period lookback).

3. MODEL TRAINING:

- hmmlearn.GaussianHMM, covariance_type="full"
- Minimum 2 years daily data (504 trading days)
- Expanding window retraining: retrain at configurable intervals
- Store model with pickle + metadata (n_regimes, bic, training_date, labels)
- Log: likelihood, BIC, convergence, iterations

4. REGIME DETECTION — NO LOOK-AHEAD BIAS:

**_ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TECHNICAL DETAIL. _**

DO NOT use model.predict(). predict() runs the Viterbi algorithm which processes the ENTIRE sequence and revises past states using future data. This is look-ahead bias that makes backtests unrealistically good.

INSTEAD implement FORWARD ALGORITHM ONLY (filtered inference):

def predict*regime_filtered(self, features_up_to_now):
Compute P(state_t | observations_1:t) using forward algorithm.
Uses ONLY past and present data. No future data. # Use model's startprob*, transmat*, means*, covars* # Implement forward pass manually: # 1. alpha_0 = startprob \* emission_prob(obs_0) # 2. alpha_t = (alpha*{t-1} @ transmat) \* emission_prob(obs_t) # 3. Normalize at each step (work in log space) # 4. alpha_T = filtered distribution at current time # Cache previous alpha for efficiency in live/backtest loop

MANDATORY TEST — tests/test_look_ahead.py:

def test_no_look_ahead_bias():

"""Regime at T must be identical with data[0:T] vs data[0:T+100]."""
model = train_hmm(full_data)
regime_short = predict_regime_filtered(data[0:400])[-1]
regime_long = predict_regime_filtered(data[0:500])[400]
assert regime_short == regime_long, "LOOK-AHEAD BIAS DETECTED"

5. REGIME STABILITY FILTER:

- Regime change only "confirmed" after persisting N bars (default 3)
- During transition: keep previous regime, reduce sizes by 25%
- Track flicker rate (changes per 20 bars)
- If flicker rate > threshold (default 4): force uncertainty mode

6. ADDITIONAL METHODS:

- predict_regime_proba() -> probability distribution
- get_regime_stability() -> consecutive bars in current regime
- get_transition_matrix() -> learned transition probabilities
- detect_regime_change() -> True only if confirmed
- get_regime_flicker_rate() -> changes per window
- is_flickering() -> True if flicker rate exceeds threshold

7. REGIME METADATA:
   RegimeInfo dataclass:

- regime_id, regime_name, expected_return, expected_volatility
- recommended_strategy_type, max_leverage_allowed
- max_position_size_pct, min_confidence_to_act

RegimeState dataclass:

- label, state_id, probability, state_probabilities
- timestamp, is_confirmed, consecutive_bars

Log regime changes as WARNING. Log confirmations as INFO.

---

# PHASE 3: Volatility-Based Allocation Strategy

Implement core/regime_strategies.py — the allocation layer that sizes positions based on the HMM's volatility regime detection.

**DESIGN INSIGHT:** The HMM excels at detecting VOLATILITY ENVIRONMENTS, not market direction. Stocks trend upward roughly 70% of the time in low-volatility periods.  
The worst drawdowns cluster in high-volatility spikes. So the strategy is simple:

- Low vol → be fully invested (calm markets trend up)
- Mid vol → stay invested if trend intact, reduce if not
- High vol → reduce but stay partially invested (catch V-shaped rebounds)

The edge comes from AVOIDING BIG DRAWDOWNS through vol-based sizing. When you cut your worst drawdown in half, compounding works in your favor over time.

ALWAYS LONG. NEVER SHORT.
Shorting was tested extensively in walk-forward backtesting and consistently destroyed returns because:

1. Markets have long-term upward drift
2. V-shaped recoveries happen fast and the HMM is 2-3 days late detecting them
3. Short positions during rebounds wipe out crash gains
   The correct response to high volatility is REDUCING allocation, not reversing direction.

### THREE STRATEGY CLASSES (based on volatility rank):

1. **LowVolBullStrategy** (lowest third of regimes by expected_volatility):
   - Direction: LONG
   - Allocation: 95% of portfolio
   - Leverage: 1.25x (modest leverage in calm conditions)
   - Stop: max(price - 3 ATR, 50 EMA - 0.5 ATR)
   - This is where most returns are generated. Calm markets + leverage = compounding.

2. **MidVolCautiousStrategy** (middle third by expected_volatility):
   - Direction: LONG
   - If price > 50 EMA: allocation 95%, leverage 1.6x (trend intact, stay invested)
   - If price < 50 EMA: allocation 60%, leverage 1.0x (trend broken, reduce)
   - Stop: 50 EMA - 0.5 ATR

3. **HighVolDefensiveStrategy** (top third by expected_volatility):
   - Direction: LONG (NOT short)
   - Allocation: 60% of portfolio
   - Leverage: 1.0x
   - Stop: 50 EMA - 1.0 ATR (wider for volatile conditions)
   - Staying 60% invested catches the sharp rebounds after selloffs.

---

### VOLATILITY RANK MAPPING:

For any regime count (3-7), map each regime's vol rank to a strategy:  
position = rank / (n_regimes - 1) # 0.0 = lowest vol, 1.0 = highest  
position <= 0.33 → LowVolBullStrategy  
position >= 0.67 → HighVolDefensiveStrategy  
else → MidVolCautiousStrategy

---

### STRATEGY ORCHESTRATOR:

- Takes regime_infos from HMM
- Sorts by expected_volatility (ascending) to compute vol_rank per regime
- Maps regime_id → vol_rank → strategy class
- This sort is INDEPENDENT of the label sort (which is by return)  
  "BULL" label does NOT mean low vol. The orchestrator ignores labels.

CONFIDENCE AND UNCERTAINTY:

- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.55 (configurable)
- Uncertainty mode triggers when: prob < threshold, or is_flickering=True
- In uncertainty mode: halve all position sizes, force leverage to 1.0x
- Append "[UNCERTAINTY — size halved]" to reasoning

REBALANCING:

- Only rebalance when target allocation differs from current by >10%
- This prevents churn from minor probability fluctuations
- Fewer trades = less slippage = better real-world performance

IMPLEMENTATION:

- BaseStrategy ABC: generate_signal(symbol, bars, regime_state) -> Optional[Signal]
- LowVolBullStrategy, MidVolCautiousStrategy, HighVolDefensiveStrategy
- StrategyOrchestrator:
  **init**(config, regime_infos): sorts by vol, maps strategies
  generate_signals(symbols, bars, regime_state, is_flickering) -> list[Signal]
  update_regime_infos(regime_infos): rebuilds mapping after HMM retrain

- Signal dataclass:
  symbol, direction (LONG or FLAT), confidence, entry_price, stop_loss
  take_profit (Optional), position_size_pct (0.60 to 0.95)
  leverage (1.0 or 1.25), regime_id, regime_name, regime_probability
  timestamp, reasoning, strategy_name, metadata

- Keep backward-compatible aliases:
  CrashDefensiveStrategy = HighVolDefensiveStrategy
  BearTrendStrategy = HighVolDefensiveStrategy
  MeanReversionStrategy = MidVolCautiousStrategy
  BullTrendStrategy = LowVolBullStrategy
  EuphoriaCautiousStrategy = LowVolBullStrategy
  etc.

- LABEL_TO_STRATEGY dict for all possible labels → strategy class

---

# PHASE 4: Walk-Forward Backtesting & Validation

Implement backtest/backtester.py, backtest/performance.py, and backtest/stress_test.py

This is an ALLOCATION-BASED walk-forward backtester. It does NOT track individual trade entries and exits. It sets a target portfolio allocation each bar based on the detected volatility regime and rebalances when the allocation changes meaningfully. This is how real systematic strategies work.

1. WALK-FORWARD OPTIMIZATION ENGINE (backtester.py):

   Rolling windows:
   - In-Sample (IS): 252 trading days (1 year) for HMM training + model selection
   - Out-of-Sample (OOS): 126 trading days (6 months) for evaluation
   - Step size: 126 trading days (6 months)

   For each window:
   a. Train HMM on IS data (BIC model selection)
   b. Compute vol rankings from trained model's regime_infos
   c. Walk through OOS bar by bar

When leverage > 1.0 (e.g., 1.25x in low vol), target*allocation > 1.0,  
so target_shares * price > equity, making cash negative. This is margin.  
equity = cash + shares \_ price is still correct because share value  
exceeds the margin debt. Alpaca supports this with 2x overnight leverage.

### REALISTIC SIMULATION:

- Slippage: 0.05% on each rebalance (configurable)
- Rebalancing threshold: 10% (prevents churn)
- Fill delay: 1 bar (signal bar N → rebalance at bar N+1 open)
- No individual trade stops in backtester (stops are for live trading only)
- Commission: $0 default (Alpaca commission-free)

---

## 2. PERFORMANCE METRICS (performance.py):

### Core:

- Total return (%), CAGR
- Sharpe ratio (annualized), Sortino ratio
- Calmar ratio (CAGR / max drawdown)
- Max drawdown: percentage AND duration in trading days
- Win rate, avg win/loss, profit factor
- Total trades, avg holding period

Regime-specific (table format):
Regime | % Time In | Return Contribution | Avg Trade P&L | Win Rate | Sharpe
Show for each detected regime. This proves each vol environment's strategy is performing as expected.

Confidence-bucketed:
Confidence | Trades | Sharpe | Win Rate | Avg P&L
< 50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70%+
If high-confidence trades outperform low-confidence → HMM adds value.

Benchmark comparisons (run automatically with --compare flag):
a. Buy-and-hold: hold the asset entire period
b. 200 SMA trend: long above 200 SMA, cash below
c. Random entry + same risk management: random allocation changes at same frequency, same position sizing rules. 100 random seeds, report mean/std.

Worst-case: worst day, worst week, worst month, max consecutive losses, longest time underwater.

Output:

- Rich formatted tables to terminal
- equity_curve.csv, trade_log.csv, regime_history.csv, benchmark_comparison.csv

3. STRESS TESTING (stress_test.py):

a. Crash injection: insert -5% to -15% single-day gaps at 10 random points.
Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations. Report: mean max loss, worst case, % where circuit breaker fired.

b. Gap risk: insert overnight gaps of 2-5x ATR at random points.
Report: expected loss vs actual.

c. Regime misclassification: deliberately shuffle regime labels.
Verify risk management contains damage even with wrong regimes.
If system blows up → risk management isn't independent enough.

4. CLI:
   python main.py backtest --symbols SPY --start 2019-01-01 --end 2024-12-31
   python main.py backtest --symbols SPY --start 2019-01-02 --end 2024-12-31 --compare
   python main.py backtest --stress-test

# PHASE 5: Risk Management Layer

Implement core/risk_manager.py.

The risk manager operates INDEPENDENTLY of the HMM. Even if the HMM fails completely, circuit breakers catch drawdowns based on actual P&L. Defense in depth. The risk manager has ABSOLUTE VETO POWER over any signal.

1. PORTFOLIO-LEVEL LIMITS:

- Max total exposure: 80% of portfolio (20% cash minimum — note: when using 1.25x leverage, the notional exposure exceeds equity but the margin requirement stays within Alpaca's limits)
- Max single position: 15%
- Max correlated exposure: 30% in one sector
- Max concurrent positions: 5
- Max daily trades: 20
- Max portfolio leverage: 1.25x

2. CIRCUIT BREAKERS (fire on actual P&L, independent of regime):

- Daily DD > 2%: reduce all sizes 50% rest of day
- Daily DD > 3%: close ALL positions, halt rest of day
- Weekly DD > 5%: reduce all sizes 50% rest of week
- Weekly DD > 7%: close ALL, halt rest of week
- Peak DD > 10%: halt ALL trading, write trading_halted.lock file requiring manual deletion to resume

Log every trigger with: breaker type, actual DD, equity, positions closed, HMM regime at time (track if HMM was wrong).

3. POSITION-LEVEL RISK:
   - Every position MUST have a stop loss — system refuses orders without one
   - Max risk per trade: 1% of portfolio
   - Position size = (portfolio \* 0.01) / abs(entry - stop_loss)
   - Cap at regime max, then portfolio max (15%)
   - Minimum position: $100
   - GAP RISK: overnight positions assume 3x stop_gap-through.
     Overnight size = min(normal, size where 3x gap/2 = 2% of portfolio)

4. LEVERAGE RULES:
   - Default: 1.0x
   - Only low-vol regimes may use up to 1.25x
   - Force 1.0x if: regime uncertain, any circuit breaker active, 3+ positions open, high flicker rate
   - Alpaca supports 2x overnight (Reg T, $2k+ equity) and 4x intraday (PDT, $25k+ equity). Our 1.25x max is deliberately conservative.

5. ORDER VALIDATION:
   - Check buying power, tradeable status, bid-ask spread < 0.5%
   - Block duplicates (same symbol + direction within 60 seconds)
   - Log every rejection with structured reason

6. CORRELATION CHECK:
   - 60-day rolling correlation with existing positions
   - Correlation > 0.7: reduce size 50%
   - Correlation > 0.85: reject trade

IMPLEMENTATION:

- RiskManager: validate_signal(signal, portfolio_state) -> RiskDecision
- RiskDecision: approved, modified_signal, rejection_reason, modifications list
- PortfolioState: equity, cash, buying_power, positions, daily/weekly pnl,
  peak equity, drawdown, circuit_breaker_status, flicker_rate
- CircuitBreaker: check(), update(pnl), reset_daily(), reset_weekly(), get_history()
- All thresholds from settings.yaml

# PHASE 6: Alpaca Broker Integration

Implement the broker/ package.

1. broker/alpaca_client.py:
   - alpaca-py SDK wrapper
   - Credentials from .env (NEVER hardcoded, .env in .gitignore)
   - Paper: https://paper-api.alpaca.markets (DEFAULT)
   - Live: https://api.alpaca.markets
   - If paper_trading: false, require confirmation:
     "⚠️ LIVE TRADING MODE. Type 'YES I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS' to confirm:"
   - Methods: get_account(), get_positions(), get_order_history(),
     is_market_open(), get_clock(), get_available_margin()
   - Health check on startup, auto-reconnect with exponential backoff

2. broker/order_executor.py:

- submit_order(signal): LIMIT orders by default (+/- 0.1% of current price), cancel after 30s if unfilled, optionally retry at market
- submit_bracket_order(signal): entry + stop + take_profit via Alpaca OCO
- modify_stop(symbol, new_stop): only tighten, never widen
- cancel_order(), close_position(), close_all_positions()
- Unique trade_id linking signal → risk_decision → order → fill

3. broker/position_tracker.py:

- WebSocket subscription for instant fill notifications
- Update PortfolioState and CircuitBreaker on every fill
- Per-position tracking: entry time/price, current price, unrealized P&L, stop level, holding period, regime at entry vs current
- Sync with Alpaca on startup (reconcile tracked vs actual positions)

4. data/market_data.py:

- get_historical_bars(symbol, timeframe, start, end)
- subscribe_bars(symbols, timeframe, callback) via WebSocket
- subscribe_quotes(symbols, callback) for spread checks
- get_latest_bar(), get_latest_quote(), get_snapshot()
- Handle gaps (weekends, holidays, halts) gracefully

# PHASE 7: Main Loop & Orchestration

Implement main.py.

## STARTUP:

1. Load config, connect to Alpaca, verify account
2. Check market hours (wait or exit if closed)
3. Load or train HMM (if model >7 days old or missing, retrain)
4. Initialize risk manager with current portfolio from Alpaca
5. Initialize position tracker, sync positions
6. Check for state_snapshot.json (recovery from previous session)
7. Start WebSocket data feeds
8. Print system state, log "System online"

## MAIN LOOP (each bar close, default 5-min bars):

1. New bar from WebSocket
2. Compute features (rolling window, no future data)
3. Filtered HMM prediction (forward algorithm only)
4. Regime stability check (3-bar persistence)
5. Flicker rate check → uncertainty mode if high
6. StrategyOrchestrator: target allocation per symbol
7. For each signal: risk_manager.validate_signal()
   → approved: order_executor.submit_order()
   → modified: log, submit modified
   → rejected: log reason

8. Update trailing stops per regime
9. Circuit breaker check
10. Dashboard refresh
11. Weekly: retrain HMM

SHUTDOWN (SIGINT/SIGTERM):

- Close WebSocket connections
- Do NOT close positions (stops in place)
- Save state_snapshot.json
- Print session summary

ERROR HANDLING:

- Alpaca API: 3 retries, exponential backoff
- HMM error: hold current regime
- Data feed drop: pause signals, keep stops active
- Unhandled: log traceback, save state, alert

CLI:
--dry-run Full pipeline, no orders
--backtest Walk-forward backtester
--train-only Train HMM and exit
--stress-test Run stress tests
--compare Benchmark comparisons
--dashboard Show dashboard for running instance

# PHASE 8: Monitoring, Alerts & Dashboard

Implement monitoring/ package.

1. monitoring/logger.py:

- Structured JSON logging
- Rotating files (10MB, 30 days): main.log, trades.log, alerts.log, regime.log
- Every entry includes: timestamp, regime, probability, equity, positions, daily_pnl

2. monitoring/dashboard.py (rich library):
   ┌ REGIME ───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ BULL (72%) | Stability: 14 bars | Flicker: 1/20 │
   ├ PORTFOLIO ───────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Equity: $105,230 | Daily: +$340 (+0.32%) │

   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Refresh every 5 seconds. Color-coded risk bars.

3. monitoring/alerts.py:

- Triggers: regime change, circuit breaker, large P&L, data feed down,
  API lost, HMM retrained, flicker exceeded
- Delivery: console, log file, email (optional), webhook (optional)
- Rate limit: 1 per event type per 15 minutes

# PHASE 9: Integration Testing & Documentation

1. TESTS:
   a. End-to-end dry run: data → HMM → strategy → risk → simulated orders
   b. Look-ahead bias: test_look_ahead.py passes, backtest identical with different end dates
